# Module Four Challenenge Report

## Overview of the Project
---

As there was a misconduct by Thomas High School regarding the grades of the ninth graders in math and reading scores. There is a need to repeat the district analysis. In this report, the resutls of redoing the analysis will be presented and the impacts on them will be investigated. 

## Results
---
Based on the table below, the following can be said: 

- The difference in the district summary between the two cases (with and without the scores of the ninth graders) is unsignificant reduction in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall. 
- The only change between the results in the school summary is the presence of unsignificant reduction in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall of the Thomas High School only; everything else is the same. 
- The perfermance was worsened, however, its ranking remained the same (third highest performing high school).
- Math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type are the same in both cases.

## Summary
---

The following are the four changes  to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced: 
- The % Overall Passing is unsignificant reduction in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall.
- the presence of unsignificant reduction in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall of the Thomas High School only.
- Unnoticeable decrease in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall in ninth grade in the grade summary (the numbers should have at least three decimal places to observe the change not in the way the data frame is formated).
- extremely small decrease in the passing percentages in math, reading, and overall in charter school type in the school type summary (the numbers should have at least three decimal places to observe the change not in the way the data frame is formated).
